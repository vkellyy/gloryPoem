That though the radiance which was once so bright be now forever taken from my sight.
Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, glory in the flower. 
We will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind.


Shortened version - William Wordsworth


William Wordsworth was a major English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the 
Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication Lyrical Ballads.
